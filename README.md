Terrorist organizations use different social media as a tool for spreading their extremist media content, Twitter is one of the most common to reach mass people. In this paper, we have focused on the development of an analytical classification model that can automatically detect terrorism-supporting tweets. In this research, we have developed three different models using the Bayes algorithm, random forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to compare their performance, finding that the last one works better by analyzing their f1-score metrics. As our system is highly dependent on data, we use data found in the literature and recent data with the twint scrapping tool. This system will help to ban terrorist content from Twitter.
